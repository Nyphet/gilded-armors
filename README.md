## **Description**
Isn't it annoying to have your full armor set and having to use golden boots in the Nether?  
With this mod you can make better use of those 4 gold ingots: each armor set can be made gilded, using 1 gold ingot in a smithing table for each armor piece!  
A full set of gilded armor will prevent Piglins from getting hostile, without having to decrease your protection.

## **Compatibility**
Compatible with [Revamped End](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/revamped-end)!  
TODO: Add gilded enderite picture  
Compatible with [Leathered Boots](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/leathered-boots)!  
TODO: Add leathered gilded boots

## **Features**
- Each Vanilla armor has its own gilded version!  
- A full set of gilded armor, even of mixed types, will prevent Piglins from getting hostile!  
- Gilded armor has the same properties of the not-gilded one.  
- Craft a gilded armor piece by putting an armor piece in a smithing table with a gold ingot!  
TODO: Add crafting recipe image  
- If Revamped End is installed, Enderite armor can become gilded!  
- If Leathered Boots is installed, any leathered boot can become gilded!  
- **Highly configurable!** See next section for more details.

## **Configuration**
- TODO
